# ⚙️ DTF Scaling Strategy – Distributed Orchestration  

> **Architectural proposal for scaling DTF beyond a single-VM environment**  
> Version 1.0 · Authored by **Geoffrey Jones**  

---

## 📘 Overview  
This proposal describes a distributed orchestration model for the **Data Transformation Framework (DTF)** — enabling it to handle high-volume, concurrent workloads across multiple virtual machines (VMs).  

The design leverages a shared **Dispatch Zone** to distribute incoming files evenly between DTF instances, allowing true parallel processing without introducing complexity to the core framework.  

---

## 🧩 Architecture Highlights  

- **Distributed Load Balancing** – Files dynamically dispatched to idle VMs  
- **Parallel Execution** – Each VM operates an independent DTF stack and browser session  
- **Unified Dispatch Zone** – Shared handoff point for incoming work  
- **Scalable Orchestration** – Easily add or remove VMs as demand changes  
- **Consistent Codebase** – All nodes run identical DTF deployments for simplified maintenance  

---

## 📈 Benefits  

✅ Increases throughput proportionally with added VMs  
✅ Maintains isolation and fault tolerance per instance  
✅ Supports future cloud or container deployment  
✅ Requires minimal reconfiguration of existing workflows
