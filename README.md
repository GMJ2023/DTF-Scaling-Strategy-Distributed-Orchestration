⚙️ **DTF Scaling Strategy – Distributed Orchestration**

End-to-end scaling concept for the Data Transformation Framework (DTF)
Version 1.0 · Authored by Geoffrey Jones

📘 **Overview**

This proposal describes a distributed orchestration model for the Data Transformation Framework (DTF) — enabling it to handle high-volume, concurrent workloads across multiple virtual machines (VMs).

The design leverages a shared Dispatch Zone to distribute incoming files evenly between DTF instances, allowing true parallel processing without introducing complexity to the core framework.

🧩 **Architecture Highlights**

Distributed Load Balancing – Files dynamically dispatched to idle VMs

Parallel Execution – Each VM operates an independent DTF stack and browser session

Unified Dispatch Zone – Shared handoff point for incoming work

Scalable Orchestration – Easily add or remove VMs as demand changes

Consistent Codebase – All nodes run identical DTF deployments for simplified maintenance

📈 **Benefits**

✅ Increases throughput proportionally with added VMs
✅ Maintains isolation and fault tolerance per instance
✅ Supports future cloud or container deployment
✅ Requires minimal reconfiguration of existing workflows

*This architecture maintains DTF’s reliability while opening the door to effortless horizontal scaling.*
